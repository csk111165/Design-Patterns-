ITERATOR DESIGN PATTERN
====================================
This is a behavioural design pattern where we provide a way for a collection object to be iterated without letting the
client to know about the iterator logic

The iterator pattern allow us to:
------------------------------------------
a) access contents of a collection without exposing its internal structure.
b) support multiple simultaneous traversals of a collection.
c) provide a uniform interface for traversing different collection.
