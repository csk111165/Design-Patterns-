FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN
======================================

In factory design pattern, we create object without exposing the logic to client and client uses the same interface to create the new objects.

Features:
----------------
1. There is one static method(called factory method) which creates and returns the type of object client wants.
2. If another object of same type is wanted by user then a new object is created and provided to client.


Our aim is to decouple the selection of type of object from client . It is at library where it should be handled the 
creation of object based on type, not at the client side.

Client should just pass the type it need and must get the type of object returned from the factory class.
Client should be responsible for destructing the factory object inside its destructor.
